# Dijkstra-and-A-algorithm-comparison

### Dijkstra's algorithm is a good algorithm, but its search method requires a long running time. To find the lowest cost path between two points, the algorithm traverses a very large area of â€‹points to find the correct path, which requires a good amount of processing time.
### On the other hand, when analyzing the A* algorithm, we can see that its search time is much smaller than the Dijkstra's algorithm, making its use more advantageous. The method used analyzes points close to the lowest cost path and not a very large area.
### A* tries to look for a better path by using a heuristic function, which gives priority to nodes that are supposed to be better than others while Dijkstra's just explore all possible ways. A* uses an additional heuristic function in the cost calculation to inform its search. The heuristic function acts as a hint to guide the algorithm towards the destination, and hopefully reducing the search space. Heuristics are admissible calculations within the scope of the work. There are several formulas that can be implemented in the algorithm under study.
### The differential for the Dijkstra's algorithm is that, in addition to analyzing the cost of the edges between the points, the A* algorithm will calculate the distance between the current point of study and the destination point, giving preference to the point geographically closer to the end point . This reduces processing time and memory usage by the CPU.
